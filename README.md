# Proximity graphs recommendation via meta-learning

This is the implementation of the [A meta-learning configuration framework for graph-based similarity search indexes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437922001016):


## Overview

- [NMSLIB](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) was employed for indexing and querying the graphs
- [ANNMF](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) is a repository containing our implementation for the proposed meta-features
- this repository is composed of individual scripts/notebooks for building the final meta-database, running the meta-learning experiments, and evaluating the recommendation effectiveness
